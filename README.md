# Ankita-s-Afternoon-Thoughts
Welcome! Here I'm going to store my random scientific thoughts, whether about biology, the world around us, or the rich environment within. 
Hold your judgements as I guess what happens in the unknown:)
Inspired by Peter Dervan - "I'm walking into a dark room. If you want to come along, man, come along!"
